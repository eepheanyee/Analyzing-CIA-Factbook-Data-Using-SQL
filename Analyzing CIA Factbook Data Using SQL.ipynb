    "- `population` — the global population.\n",
    "- `population_growth` — the annual population growth rate, as a percentage.\n",
    "- `area` — the total land and water area.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I'll use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to analyze data from this database. If you want to work on this project locally, you can download the SQLite factbook.db database [here](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/257/factbook.db)"
