Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL

INTRODUCTION
In this project, I'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The factbook contains demographic information like the following:

population — the global population.
population_growth — the annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
area — the total land and water area.
In this project, I'll use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to analyze data from this database.
